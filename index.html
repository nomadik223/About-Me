        <h1>About Austin Rogers!</h1>

        <p>I was born in 1997 in Mesa, Arizona. I spent a solid 95% of my time in front of my laptop on the internet. I like to think of myself as a huge nerd, enjoying a lot of things such as Dungeons and Dragons, videogames of all consoles and publishers, and a fair bit of anime. Most of my time is spent playing online games with my friends, though I have taken up writing fanfiction in my spare time in the past week or so. I am also an animal lover, having two pets of my own, of whom I will talk about later.</p>
        <p class="Games">I play a lot of games. Like, <b>A LOT</b> of games. Mostly consisting of Role playing games and first person shooters, some of my favorite games include entries from the Pokemon franchise, Call of Duty 4 Modern Warfare, Payday 2, Paper Mario and the Thousand Year Door, and entries from the Fire Emblem franchise.</p>
        <p class="Games">Though some people stick with one console to play their games, I enjoy a more diverse library, playing games on Mricrosoft's XBox One, Nintendo's Wii U, and my most played systems, my Laptop and the Nintendo 3DS handheld.
        <p id="Pets">Pets have been a huge part of the lives of my family, particularly in my life. Namely, we have had 5 dogs, currently owning 2. When my family lived in Arizona, we had 2 dogs at first, one of them being called Jazz. Unfortunately, her and our other dog fought a lot, so we ended up giving her away to a coworker of my dad's or something like that. I was too young to really remember. Our other dog was a Black Lab by the name of Thumper. From what I remember, she was an incredibly lazy dog, except when she went swimming. This next dog is a bit of a story to be sure. His name was Fezzik, and I would tell you his breed if anyone actually knew what he was. No vet or dog expert could tell us, but we didn't care. He was this skinny little ball of love and adoration, though also incredibly picky. I admit I spoiled him a bit with treats. He also seemed to be invincible, eating so much chocolate, chicken wings, garbage and lord knows what else he really shouldn't have gotten in to, but still living a long and happy life. Unfortunately, his health deteriorated rapidly in my Junior and Senior year in high school, and we put him down, middle of my 1st semester of my senior year. I still have his Dog-tags on my keychain. Backing up a bit, not long after my family oved to Washington, we wanted to get a second dog to keep Fezzik company. We looked around and decided on this teeny tiny Black lab puppy, soon to be named Arya. This is a large dog who never really grew up, and still thinks she is a lapdog. A great big ball of fluffy love, Arya is a puppy to the core. However, when Fezzik passed, the impact was felt through the entire family, so we decided to get another friend for Arya. Eventually, we settled on the dog we have now along with Arya, named Maou. This boy is SOOOOOO needy sometimes and he gets VERY jealous of Arya, but he is a good dog none the less, and a welcome part of our family.</p>
